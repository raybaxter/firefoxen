Firefoxen is simple utility for configuring multiple versions of Firefox on Mac OS X so that you can use them at once. The different versions must launch different profiles if they are to be used simultaneously. 

Usage
-----

From the command line, run firefoxen.rb appName profileName to modify a single instance of Firefox to run with a different profile.

Example: 

$ ./firefoxen.rb Firefox3 ff3-profile

Otherwise, you can run firefoxen without any arguments to update all you locally configured versions of Firefox. Just modify the VERSIONS array in the file to modify your current selected set of Firefoxen. This has the advantage that you can run it on a number of versions repetitively (if you update from version 3.0 to 3.1 for instance. You currently must use this if you would like to further customize your installs with the path to Firefox, or a special name for the firefox-bin executable. The other advantage is that you can then also run:

$ ./firefoxen.rb -r 

to revert to the default Firefox behavior.

Creating Firefox Profiles
-------------------------

If the profileName that you specified above does not already exist, you will be presented with the Profilie Manager when you next open that instance of Firefox.  Create the profile you specified above.  You will not be presented with the Profile Manager again if done correctly.

See http://kb.mozillazine.org/Command_line_arguments

You can also create a Firefox profile from the command line:
$ /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -CreateProfile new-profile

or interactively:
$ /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -ProfileManager

Icons
-----

There are some zip files containing .icns files. You can replace the apps .icns files with the ones provided if you would like to have custom icons. 
Right click on your /Applications/[appName].app and choose 'Show Package Contents' you can then replace the file under Contents/Resources/firefox.icns with one of the ones in the provided zip. Make sure to rename it properly.

Joe and Jonathan added the method of calling by passing in the appName and profileName, and created the custom icons.
