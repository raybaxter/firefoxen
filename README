Firefoxen is simple utility for configuring multiple versions of Firefox on Mac OS X so that you can use them at once. The different versions must launch different profiles if they are to be used simultaneously. 

Usage
-----

Edit firefoxen.rb according to the information in the header. At a minimum you need to specify the names of the Firefox versions that you intend to use and the name of the profile that you intend to use it with. It is assumed that your Firefox versions are in /Application folder, but you can override that location by specifying a path.

Then from the command line

$ ./firefoxen.rb

To reverse the changes and return to a default installation (all version of Firefox use the same profile):

$ ./firefoxen.rb -r

Creating Firefox Profiles
-------------------------

See http://kb.mozillazine.org/Command_line_arguments

You can create a Firefox profile from the command line:
$ /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -CreateProfile new-profile

or interactively:
$ /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -ProfileManager

We Added some .icns files that you may find useful to tell your apps apart when you have multiple Firefox's running.  The fastest way to change the icon of your app is to "get info" (Cmd-i) on both your app and this custom .icns file, then copy the tiny icon from top left of the .icns info pane and paste it into the tiny icon from top left of the the apps info pane.
